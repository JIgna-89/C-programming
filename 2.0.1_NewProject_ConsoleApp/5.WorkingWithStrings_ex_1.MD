## Exercise 1: Working With Strings

Relevant info: [Remarks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=netcore-3.1#remarks) on `string`

### Practice exercises with `string` properties

- #### [String.Chars[Int32] Property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.chars?view=netcore-3.1#System_String_Chars_System_Int32_)
To access the elements/characters from a string, we use `String.Chars[]` property to access the characters of a string from the specified index.

`String.Chars[Int32]` gets the `Char` object at a specified position in the current `String` object.

`Int32` is the number of characters in the current string.

Code `phrase[i]` found in this example:
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Geeks
    {
        // Main Method 
        public static void Main()
        {
            string phrase = "GeeksforGeeks";
            for (int i = 0; i <= phrase.Length - 1; i++)
            {
                Console.Write("{0} ", phrase[i]);
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```cs
G e e k s f o r G e e k s
```

- #### [String.Length Property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.length?view=netcore-3.1#System_String_Length)
Code `phrase[phrase.Length - 1]` found in this example:
```cs
using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string phrase = "Superhero landing. You know, it's really hard on your knees."; //60 chars

            Console.WriteLine("First character is: " + phrase[0] + ".");
            Console.WriteLine("Last character is: " + phrase[phrase.Length - 1] + ".");
            Console.WriteLine("Total amount of characters: " + phrase.Count() + ".\n");


            //printing all characters based on the index
            for (int loop = 0; loop < phrase.Length; loop++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Character at {0} index is = {1}", loop, phrase[loop]);
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```
Note on exercise: as I was playing, I got the new using addition `using System.Linq;` and may be time to figure it out.
- if deleted, I get this error:

*Error CS1061: 'string' does not contain a definition for 'Count' and no accessible extension method 'Count' accepting a first argument of type 'string' could be found (are you missing a __using directive__ or an assembly reference?)â€¦*

**Answer**: LINQ allows queries in expression syntax. Thus, for whatever query in a variable, you need to use the `using System.Linq` directive.

**GOOD TO KNOW**: Another find is the similarity of query syntax from [Query expression basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/query-expression-basics#:~:text=In%20LINQ%2C%20a%20query%20variable,MoveNext%20method.) to SQL:
```cs
//Query syntax
IEnumerable<City> queryMajorCities =
    from city in cities
    where city.Population > 100000
    select city;

// Method-based syntax
IEnumerable<City> queryMajorCities2 = cities.Where(c => c.Population > 100000);
```
*More on this later.*


Output of *"Superhero landing"*:
```

### Practice exercises with `string` methods
Relevant info:
- [String methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=netcore-3.1#methods)

*NOTE: this is by no means an exhaustive list of `string` methods used here.*

- -  `string.Copy` method
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string phrase = "Superhero landing. You know, it's really hard on your knees."; //60 chars

            string phrase2 = string.Copy(phrase);   //string.Copy(str) is deprecated. Better use .CopyTo

            Console.WriteLine("Original phrase: " + phrase);

            phrase = "\", said Deadpool.";

            Console.WriteLine("Copied phrase: " + phrase2);

            Console.WriteLine("Last new phrase: " + phrase);


            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Original phrase: Superhero landing. You know, it's really hard on your knees.
Copied phrase: Superhero landing. You know, it's really hard on your knees.
Last new phrase: ", said Deadpool.
```

- - `String.CopyTo(Int32, Char[], Int32, Int32)` method
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string deadpoolPhrase = "Superhero landing. You know, it's really hard on your knees."; //60 chars

            Console.WriteLine(deadpoolPhrase);

            //Convert string deadpoolPhrase to chars char[] charDeadP_Arr.
            char[] charDeadP_Arr = new char[20];    //20 spaces just in case. There was no reason for a larger number in a new array.
            char[] charDeadP_Arr2 = new char[60];   //60 spaces just in case. There was no reason for a larger number in a new array.

            //Copy the first 17 chars of the charDeadP_Arr array
            deadpoolPhrase.CopyTo(0, charDeadP_Arr, 0, 17);

            //Write in a new line the first 17 chars copied in a single line.
            Console.WriteLine(charDeadP_Arr);

            //Copy the second sentence in the array.
            deadpoolPhrase.CopyTo(19, charDeadP_Arr2, 0, 41);       // int count substracts from the first arrawy; so, in order to execute properly, 60 - 19 = 41.

            Console.WriteLine(charDeadP_Arr2);

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```
Output:
```
Superhero landing. You know, it's really hard on your knees.
Superhero landing
You know, it's really hard on your knees.
```

****************
**Final comment**: I think I am adding useless comments inline. But these work for me to understand my code.

I guess developers just explain in more simple and direct terms.
