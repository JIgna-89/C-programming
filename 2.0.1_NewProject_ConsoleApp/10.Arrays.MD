# Arrays

Source video: [C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners, Arrays](https://youtu.be/GhQdlIFylQ8?t=4876)

**Array**: (def.)  a group of like-typed variables that *are referred to by a common name* **and** *each can hold multiple pieces of information of the same type*. And each data item is called an *element of the array*. The data types of the elements may be any valid data type like char, int, float, etc. and the elements are stored in a contiguous location. *Length* of the array specifies the number of elements present in the array.

> Same datatype which can be converted. Thus, if you know how to convert, you can store multiple data in the same array.

In C# the **allocation of memory** for the arrays is done *dynamically*. And arrays are kind of objects, therefore it is easy to find their size using the predefined functions. The variables in the array are ordered and each has an **index beginning from 0**. Arrays in C# work differently than they do in C/C++.

Types of dimensioal arrays:
- 1D
- 2D
- 3D

## Starting code
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            Console.ReadLine();

        }
    }
}
```

## Final program
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //int array
            int[] luckyNumbers = { 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 }; //1D array
            //  index ==>          0  1   2   3   4   5
            

            //update one value of the array
            //luckyNumbers[1] = 900;
            
            //how to access to array
            //Console.WriteLine( luckyNumbers[1] ); //access by index number starting from 0.


            //string 1D array
            string[] friends = new string[5];    //new string [nÂ° of elements the array holds]
            //populate 5-defined array
            friends[0] = "Jim";
            friends[1] = "Kelly";


            Console.ReadLine();

        }
    }
}
```

> I understand arrays and I might already be able to perform CRUD methods with multidimensional arrays using the console. The next video is great to learn MVC and SQL procedures. More info: [Full CRUD in ASP.NET Core MVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz7Xn-Cjba0). By the way, awesome video.
