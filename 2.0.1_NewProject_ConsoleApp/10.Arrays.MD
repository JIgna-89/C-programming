**Array**: (def.)  a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. And each data item is called an *element of the array*. The data types of the elements may be any valid data type like char, int, float, etc. and the elements are stored in a contiguous location. *Length* of the array specifies the number of elements present in the array.

In C# the **allocation of memory** for the arrays is done *dynamically*. And arrays are kind of objects, therefore it is easy to find their size using the predefined functions. The variables in the array are ordered and each has an **index beginning from 0**. Arrays in C# work differently than they do in C/C++.
