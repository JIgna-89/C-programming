### *system* lines:
These specify what we want to use in C#.
```cs
using System;
//â€¦
```

## *namespace* line:
```cs
namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
```
The **namespace** is defined with the name of the project: *ConsoleApp_Giraffe*

- Uses of **namespaces**:

Namespaces are used in C# to organize and provide a level of separation of codes. They can be considered as a container which consists of other namespaces, classes, etc.

A **namespace** can have following types as its members:
1. Namespaces (Nested Namespace)
2. Classes
3. Interfaces
4. Structures
5. Delegates

**Namespaces** are not mandatory in a C# program, but they do play an important role in writing cleaner codes and managing larger projects.

Example of **namespace** usage:

```cs
using System;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class SampleClass
    {
        public static void myMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Creating my namespace");
        }
    }
}
 
namespace MyProgram
{
    public class MyClass
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            MyNamespace.SampleClass.myMethod();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above program, we have created our own namespace `MyNamespace` and accessed its members from `Main()` method inside `MyClass`. As said earlier, the dot (`.`) operator is used to access the member of namespace.

In the `Main()` method, `myMethod()` method is called using the dot (`.`) operator.
