## Extra info on data types

After seeing this video section, I decided that it's just enough already and I will try to understand methods of the string data type.


One thing that bothers me is the relation of string class and string data type. Although there are `String` and `string`, I will most probably use the **debugger** with *several breakpoints*. I consider it the best tool to actually see how the code works. 

I finally found the corrsponding info: *[Difference between String and string in C#.](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/articles/difference-between-string-and-string-in-csharp) for more info*.

> *Too much theory without practice —which is what I have normally encounter in different course— have just made my brain tired and not craving for more.*

If everything goes well, I will restart the course on the next topic.


## Search:
After web search, I am not the only one with the same doubt:

- [Diff btw class and datatype](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5164005/what-is-the-difference-between-a-class-and-a-datatype#:~:text=A%20data%20type%20can%20be%20described%20as%20being%20either%3A&text=Reference%20Types%20(C%23%20Reference)%2C,references%20to%20the%20actual%20data.&text=Classes%20are%20Reference%20Types.,within%20its%20own%20memory%20allocation.), which led me to the following,
- [Diff btw struct and class in .NET?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13049/whats-the-difference-between-struct-and-class-in-net), and later to
- [Choosing Between Class and Struct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/choosing-between-class-and-struct), which I think is way above me as I don't think I'll be creating any new `struct` in the near future.

However interesting the concept of `struct` may be, it turns out it was not what I was actually looking.

### What I was looking
The section [Types (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/) contains all the info you need.
The main difference is that you can use [built-in types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/#built-in-types) or you can create your [custom types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/#custom-types).

> **Conclusion**:
Better stick with already made classes (reference types) and data types (defined value types). SDKs —which may contain more different types— are built by framework designers and for programmers.

### Core differences btw value and reference types:
- a variable of a **value type** contains *an instance of the type*;
- a variable of a **reference type** contains *a reference to an instance of the type*.

## Useful info about conversion and casting
If you want to look for type conversion, see [Casting and type conversions (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions). What comes handy is that this section provides a guide for converting one datatype to another. 
> *BEWARE*: even though `double` to `int` are compatible, if casted, we are assigning a smaller value from `double` to `int` and you may lose data by doing so. I'll see if I can find a chart or list somewhere.

### **Conversion =! Casting**
 If the data types are compatible, then C# does **Automatic Type Conversion**. If not comparable, then they need to be converted explicitly which is known as **Explicit Type conversion**.
In C#, you can perform the following kinds of conversions:

- **Implicit conversions**: No special syntax is required because the conversion is type safe and no data will be lost. Examples include conversions from smaller to larger integral types, and conversions from derived classes to base classes. List of [Implicit conversions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/conversions#implicit-conversions). Sample code: 
```cs
int val1 = 10;  
double val2 =val1;
```

- **Explicit conversions (casts)**: Explicit conversions require a [cast expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-cast#cast-expression). Casting is required when information might be lost in the conversion, or when the conversion might not succeed for other reasons. Typical examples include numeric conversion to a type that has less precision or a smaller range, and conversion of a base-class instance to a derived class. *This entails lose of info*.  Sample code:
```cs
double x = 1234.7;
int a = (int)x;
Console.WriteLine(a);   // output: 1234
```

- **User-defined converions**: User-defined conversions are performed by special methods that you can define to enable explicit and implicit conversions between custom types that do not have a base class–derived class relationship. For more information, see User-defined conversion operators.
*I'll return to this when I understand some more info*.

- **Conversions with helper classes**: this is great! You have an already made class to convert datatypes. To convert between non-compatible types, such as integers and [System.DateTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime?view=netcore-3.1) objects, or hexadecimal strings and byte arrays, you can use the [System.BitConverter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.bitconverter?view=netcore-3.1) class, the [System.Convert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert?view=netcore-3.1) class, and the `Parse` methods of the built-in numeric types, such as [Int32.Parse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32.parse?view=netcore-3.1). For more information, see [How to convert a byte array to an int](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-convert-a-byte-array-to-an-int), [How to convert a string to a number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-convert-a-string-to-a-number), and [How to convert between hexadecimal strings and numeric types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-convert-between-hexadecimal-strings-and-numeric-types).


## Data Types chart

I thought of creating one myself with UML but there already are nice graphs with all the relevant info.
> I just want to keep it simple andbe able to understand: *economy of effort*.

I will create one file on this since it will serve as base documentation. Link: [C# Data Types chart](4.DataTypes_chart_CSharp.MD).
