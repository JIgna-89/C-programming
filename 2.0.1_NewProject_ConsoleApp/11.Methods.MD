Method (defs.):
- MS: is a **code block** that *contains a series of statements*. A program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments. In C#, every executed instruction is performed in the context of a method. The `Main` method is the entry point for every C# application and it is called by the **common language runtime (CLR)** when the program is started.

More info: [MS Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/methods#:~:text=A%20method%20is%20a%20code,the%20context%20of%20a%20method.) and [MS CLR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr).

- Geekforgeeks: are generally the **block of codes or statements** in a program that gives the user the ability to **reuse the same code** which ultimately saves the excessive use of memory, acts as a time saver and more importantly, it **provides a better readability of code**. So basically, a method *is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller*. A method *can also perform some specific task without returning anything*.
