## Starting code

```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("There once was a man named George");
            Console.WriteLine("He was 70 years old");
            Console.WriteLine("He erally liked the name George");
            Console.WriteLine("But he didn't like being 70");

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```
A **variable** is a container where we can store types of information.
