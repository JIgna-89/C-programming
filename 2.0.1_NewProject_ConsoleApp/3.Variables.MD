## Starting code

```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("There once was a man named George");
            Console.WriteLine("He was 70 years old");
            Console.WriteLine("He really liked the name George");
            Console.WriteLine("But he didn't like being 70");

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```
#### Short definition:
A **_variable_** is a container where we can store specific data value and such data value can be reused by referring to the variable's name.

#### Long definition:
A **_variable_** is a name given to a **discreet memory location** and all the **operations done** on the variable effects that memory location. In C#, all the variables must be **declared** before they can be used. It is the **basic unit of storage** in a program. The **value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution (_run-time_)**.

## Final program
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //use variables for distinct pieces of information
            string characterName = "Tom";   //declare and assign value to varible
            int characterAge;               //declare variable
            characterAge = 25;              //assign value to variable

            Console.WriteLine("There once was a man named " + characterName + "."); //string concatenation for story
            Console.WriteLine("He was " + characterAge + " years old.");

            characterName = "Mike";         //update characterName value
            Console.WriteLine("He really liked the name " + characterName + ".");
            Console.WriteLine("But he didn't like being " + characterAge + " years old.");

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```
