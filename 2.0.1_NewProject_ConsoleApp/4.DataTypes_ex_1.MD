## Exercise 1: data types

Following the video, I saw there are plenty of exercises regarding data types. I would go ahead and see what they are about as Mike Dane said he would.

However, I want to try sth first.

```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string puppyName = "Bailey";
            int dogAgeInMonths = 8;

            string phraseA1 = "I have a dog";
            string phraseA2 = "named " + puppyName;

            string phraseB1 = "She is " + dogAgeInMonths + " months old.";

            //declare and initialize const
            string const FULLPHRASE = phraseA1 + " " + phraseA2 + ". " + phraseB1;
            
            Console.WriteLine(fullPhrase);


            Console.ReadLine();

            //Returns:
            //I have a dog Bailey. She is 8 months old.
        }
    }
}
```

*Final doubt*: are caps used in constants or not?

Answer from Sr programmer ==> Do not use caps for anything.
