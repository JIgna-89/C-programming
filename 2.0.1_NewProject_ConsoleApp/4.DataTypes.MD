# Data Types

Source video: [C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners, Data Types](https://youtu.be/GhQdlIFylQ8?t=1806)

Different types of data that can be represented and worked with in C#.

## Starting code
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

### Concepts of data types and constants
*NOTE*: MS expands C# types to value types and reference types. More as I advance.

#### - [Value or] Data types (expanded)

1. [Simple types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-types#built-in-value-types)

1.1. Signed integral: `sbyte`, `short`, `int`, `long`

1.2. Unsigned integral: `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`

1.3. Unicode characters: `char`

1.4. IEEE binary floating-point: `float`, `double`

1.5. High-precision decimal floating-point: `decimal`

1.6. Boolean: `bool`

2. [`Enum` types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum)

2.1. User-defined types of the form `enum E {...}`

3. [`Struct` types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct)

3.1. User-defined types of the form `struct S {...}`

4. [Nullable value types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types)

4.1. Extensions of all other value types with a `null` value

5. [Tuple value types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tuples)

5.1. User-defined types of the form `(T1, T2, ...)`


#### - Constants
Constants are **immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of the program**. Constants are *declared* with the **`const` modifier**. Only the C# built-in types (excluding `System.Object`) may be declared as `const`.

Source [MS, Constants (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.)

###### Sample code:
```cs
class Calendar1
{
    public const int Months = 12;
}
```

*Personal note*: Honestly, I understand some value types so far. I would need to delve into each whenever I have the chance.

## Final program
```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp_Giraffe
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Letters and characters
            string phrase = "Deadpool or Wolverine";    //plain-text data
            char grade = "A";                           //single character data. If in need of more than 1 character, you should use string data type.
            
            //Numbers
            int age = 30;                               //+ or - numbers without decimals. No need of ""
            float, double, decimal                      //numbers with decimals start from less to more accurate
            double gpa = 3.0;                           //double is used in C# Tutorial for begineers. You need to include the decimals even these are 0 (zero)
            decimal money = 300.25;                     //DType decimal is used to be the most accurate you can
            
            //True or false
            bool isMale = true;                         //Only stores 2 values: true or false

            //Constants 
            Console.WriteLine(Wolverine);
            Console.WriteLine(A);
            Console.WriteLine(30);
            Console.WriteLine(true);
            

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

**Final note**: I am tired of manually saving. I should have thought about it earlier. Now, VS Code autosave is enabled.
