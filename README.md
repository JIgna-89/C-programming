# C\# Programming Tutorial
Learn to code in C#

**This Git repo aims to go through the entire 4 h and 30 min tutorial provided by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and also start with MS C# documentation.**

*This also serves me as practice to learn markdown language.*

**Worth to mention**: I have a BA in English-Spanish translation looking to transition to the software field. Luckily, I do have practice in regex and these have made me eager to learn more about programming and databases.
