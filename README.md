# C\# Programming Tutorial
## Learn to code in C#

**This Git repo aims to go through the entire 4 h and 30 min tutorial provided by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and also start with MS C# documentation.**

*This also serves me as practice to learn GitHub and markdown (MD) language.*

#### Worth to mention:
I have a BA in English-Spanish translation and I am looking to transition to the software field. Luckily, I do have practice in regex and some SQL. These it have made me eager to learn more about programming and databases.

What I am trying to prove is if it is possible for a major in Social Sciences to transition to software.

I do recognize it is a long path to accomplish and I'd appreciate any help.
