# C\# Programming Tutorial
## Learn to code in C#

**This Git repo aims to document the entire training of 4 h and 30 min tutorial provided by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and also start with [Microsoft docs about C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).**

*This also serves me as practice to learn GitHub and markdown (MD) language.*

Source video: [C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/GhQdlIFylQ8).

I will try to add exercises to each created file.

#### Worth to mention:
I have a BA in English-Spanish translation and I am looking to transition to the software field. Luckily, I do have practice in regex and some SQL syntax. These have made me eager to learn more about programming and databases.

What I am trying to prove is if it is possible for a major in Social Sciences to transition to software.

I do recognize it is a long path to accomplish and I'd appreciate any help.
